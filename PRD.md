## Design Direction
The interface should evoke the precision of aerospace mission control combined with the approachability of modern transportation apps - serious and authoritative yet accessible to operators under pressure. Clean, data-dense displays with purposeful color coding that immediately communicates system status and urgency levels.

## Color Selection
Triadic color scheme using safety-standard colors that communicate operational status effectively.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Navy Blue (oklch(0.25 0.1 240)) - Communicates reliability, authority, and technological sophistication
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Neutral Gray (oklch(0.85 0.02 200)) - For background elements and non-critical data
  - Cool Blue (oklch(0.7 0.15 220)) - For informational states and standard operations
- **Accent Color**: Safety Orange (oklch(0.75 0.2 50)) - For critical alerts, emergency states, and action-required items
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Navy #0A1628): White text (oklch(0.95 0 0)) - Ratio 12.1:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray #F5F6FA): Dark Navy text (oklch(0.2 0.1 240)) - Ratio 8.5:1 ✓
  - Primary (Navy #0A1628): White text (oklch(0.95 0 0)) - Ratio 12.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Safety Orange #E87722): White text (oklch(0.95 0 0)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should convey technical precision and reliability while maintaining excellent readability under stress conditions.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (System Status): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Module Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Section Labels): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Data Values): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Small (Timestamps): Inter Regular/14px/compressed spacing

## Animations
Animations should enhance operational efficiency through clear state transitions and attention direction, with subtle feedback that builds confidence in system responsiveness rather than flashy effects that distract from critical information.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion reinforces data hierarchy and guides operator attention to changing conditions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Emergency alerts receive highest animation priority, followed by status changes, then routine updates

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Dashboard layout with Card containers, Alert dialogs for emergencies, Tabs for module switching, Progress indicators for system health, Badge components for status indicators
- **Customizations**: Custom gauge components for real-time metrics, specialized map integration for network visualization, timeline components for incident tracking
- **States**: Clear hover/active states for all controls, loading states for data processing, error states with recovery options
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons emphasizing clarity - Train, Warning, Shield, Activity, MapPin for different system functions
- **Spacing**: Consistent 16px base spacing with 8px micro-spacing for dense data displays
- **Mobile**: Responsive design prioritizing critical alerts and primary controls, with progressive disclosure of detailed data on larger screens
